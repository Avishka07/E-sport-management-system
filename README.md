# ðŸŽ® Profile Matching Algorithm for E-sports Management System

ðŸš€ Thrilled to share my ongoing Final Year Project at SLTC!

## Project Overview
This project is a *Profile Matching Algorithm for an E-sports Management System* designed to create a personalized and engaging experience for players. Our platform matches players with games based on data-driven recommendations.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- *PostgreSQL*: Core database for managing the platformâ€™s data.
- *Neo4j*: Graph database for personalized game recommendations.
- *Flask*: Backend framework to handle server logic and API integration.
- *React*: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- *Tailwind CSS*: CSS framework for a modern, responsive design.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

### Main System
Our platform follows a *modular architecture*:
- *Frontend: Built with **React* and *Tailwind CSS* for a dynamic, responsive user experience.
- *Backend: Developed with **Flask* to manage API requests and core functionalities.
- *Database: **PostgreSQL* handles primary data storage, ensuring data integrity and security.

### Recommendation Engine
Using *Neo4j's graph database, we provide players with **personalized game recommendations* based on player-game relationships. This feature adds an engaging, tailored experience to help users discover new games.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
We're excited to bring this project to life and dive deeper into the field of *data-driven matchmaking* for the e-sports industry!
